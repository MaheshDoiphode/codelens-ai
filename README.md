## Why CodeLens AI? ü§î

Tired of manually copying and pasting code, running separate `git diff` commands, or generating `tree` outputs? CodeLens AI streamlines these processes:

-   **üß† LLM Prompting:** Quickly gather relevant code snippets and file contents (including from library sources) into a single, ordered, formatted block to provide maximum context for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot Chat.
-   **üìö Documentation:** Assemble code examples from different parts of your project or dependencies effortlessly, maintaining a logical order.
-   **üí¨ Code Sharing:** Share context-rich snippets in issues, pull requests, or team chats without hassle.
-   **‚úÖ Code Review:** Generate focused `git diff` outputs for specific files, directories, or logical groups (sessions) directly within VS Code.
-   **üìã Structure Overview:** Copy clean, text-based directory tree structures for documentation or sharing, with configurable exclusions.
-   **üìÇ Organization:** Use independent **Sessions** to group resources for different tasks, features, or bug reports. Your sessions and their contents **persist** across VS Code restarts!

## Features üöÄ

-   **üíæ Full Session Persistence:** Your sessions, the resources within them (identified by URI), their hierarchy, and their custom order are **saved and restored** automatically when you restart VS Code.
-   **‚ú® Multiple Sessions:** Create, rename, and manage independent sessions to organize different sets of resources logically.
-   **‚ûï Add Active Editor:** Quickly add the currently focused editor tab to a session using an inline button.
-   **ü™ü Add All Open Editors:** Add all unique open editor tabs to a specific session using an inline button (excludes duplicates and the session's own generated document).
-   **üñ±Ô∏è Drag & Drop:** Add standard files or entire directories just by dragging them from the VS Code Explorer onto a session.
-   **‚ÜïÔ∏è Reorder Items:** Easily drag and drop resources *within* a session's level to change their order. This order is saved and used when generating output.
-   **üå≤ Hierarchical View:** Added directories retain their structure within the session view.
-   **üëì Improved Display:** Resources in the tree view show their base name (e.g., `MyClass.java`) as the primary label and the contextual path (e.g., `my-library.jar!/.../mypackage`) as the description. Full path visible in tooltip.
-   **üñ±Ô∏è Click to Open:** Single-click any file or resource item in the tree view to open it directly in the editor.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Exclusions:**
    *   Define glob patterns (`codelensai.exclude`) to ignore unwanted files/folders during **drag-and-drop** from the Explorer.
    *   Define glob patterns (`codelensai.excludeFromTree`) to ignore items when using the **Copy Directory Structure** feature.
-   ‚ö° **Per-Item Actions:** Quickly perform actions directly on items:
    *   **Inline Icons (Hover):**
        *   **Session:** `‚ûï` (Add Active Editor), `ü™ü` (Add All Editors), `üìÑ` (Generate), `üìã` (Copy Content), `üóëÔ∏è` (Clear).
        *   **Directory:** `üìÑ` (Generate Content), `üìã` (Copy Content), `list-tree` (Copy Structure), `‚ùå` (Remove).
        *   **File:** `‚ùå` (Remove).
    *   **Right-Click Context Menu:**
        *   **Session:** Git Diff options, Undo Last Removal, Expand All Subdirectories, Copy Directory Structure, Rename, Remove Session.
        *   **Directory/File:** Git Diff options, Remove Item.

-   **üìÇ Directory Management:** Expand all subdirectories within a session using the session's right-click menu options for better navigation.
-   **üìÑ On-Demand Generation:** Create clean, editable documents for session content or Git diffs when needed.
-   **üìã Easy Copying:** Copy formatted Markdown content, Git diffs, or directory structures to your clipboard with single clicks.
-   **‚ùå Fine-Grained Removal:** Remove individual resources or directories (and their children) from a session easily via an inline icon.
-   **üå≥ Copy Directory Structure (`tree`):** Copy a text-based tree view of the hierarchical structure within a session or a specific directory item (respecting `excludeFromTree` settings).
-   **‚ÜîÔ∏è Git Diff Integration:** Generate diffs (`git diff HEAD`) for tracked files within sessions, directories (`file://` scheme only, recursive), or individual files. View diffs in a document or copy directly to the clipboard. Requires the built-in `vscode.git` extension.
-   **üí® Asynchronous & Responsive:** Built with async operations to keep your editor snappy.
-   **üî¢ Optional Line Numbers:** Toggle line numbering for generated content from the view title action ("Toggle Line Numbers") or via the `codelensai.numberLines` setting (default: `false`).

    *   **Rename:** Right-click a session name -> "Rename Session".
    *   **Remove:** Right-click a session name -> "Remove Session" (requires confirmation).

3.  **Add Resources:**
    *   **Method 1: Drag & Drop (Files/Folders):**
        *   Drag files or directories from the VS Code **Explorer**.
        *   Drop them onto the desired **Session item** or into the view's empty space (adds to the first session).
        *   Exclusions defined in `codelensai.exclude` settings will apply here.
    *   **Method 2: Add Active Editor (Single Resource):**
        *   Open the file or resource you want to add in a VS Code editor tab.
        *   In the CodeLens AI view, hover over the desired **Session item**.
        *   Click the `‚ûï` (Add Active Editor) icon that appears inline.
        *   (`codelensai.exclude` settings do *not* apply here).
    *   **Method 3: Add All Open Editors (Multiple Resources):**
        *   Have multiple relevant files open in editor tabs.
        *   In the CodeLens AI view, hover over the desired **Session item**.
        *   Click the `ü™ü` (Add All Open Editors) icon that appears inline.
        *   All unique open editors (excluding duplicates, items already in the session, and the session's generated document) will be added to the session root.
        *   (`codelensai.exclude` settings do *not* apply here).

4.  **Interact with Items:**
    *   Expand/Collapse Session or Directory: Click `‚ñ∂`/`‚ñº` or the item label.
    *   The primary label shows the resource name (e.g., `MyClass.java`).
    *   The grey text description next to it shows context (e.g., `my-library.jar!/.../mypackage` or relative path).
    *   **Open Item:** Single-click any file or resource item (non-directory) to open it in the editor.
    *   **Reorder:** Drag an item within the same level (Session root or inside a Directory) and drop it above/below another item to change the order used for content generation.

5.  **Session Actions:**
    *   **Inline Icons (Hover):**
        *   `‚ûï` (Add Active Editor)
        *   `ü™ü` (Add All Open Editors)
        *   `üìÑ` (Generate Code Block Document)
        *   `üìã` (Copy Code Block Content)
        *   `üóëÔ∏è` (Clear Session - **Immediately** removes all items)

        *   Copy Git Diff for File vs HEAD
        *   Remove File from session

7.  **Advanced Directory Management:**
    *   **Expand All Subdirectories:** Right-click on a session and select this option to expand all directories to show their full content (up to 3 levels deep as per VS Code limitations).
    *   **Undo Last Removal:** Accidentally removed files or directories? Right-click on the session and select "Undo Last Removal" to restore the most recently removed items.

8.  **Using Git Diff:**
    *   Requires the built-in `vscode.git` extension to be enabled.
    *   Operates on resources with the `file://` scheme that are tracked by Git.
    *   Compares the state of tracked files against `HEAD`.
    *   **Session Scope:** Diffs all tracked `file://` resources within the session.
    *   **Directory Scope:** Recursively diffs all tracked `file://` resources under that directory *within the session*.
    *   **File Scope:** Diffs the single tracked file.
    *   Untracked files or non-`file://` resources are skipped.
    *   `Generate Diff` opens the output in a new `.diff` editor tab.
    *   `Copy Diff` copies the output directly to the clipboard.

9.  **Copying Directory Structure (`list-tree` on Directory/Session):**
    *   Generates a text-based tree representation similar to the `tree` command.
    *   Copies the structure to the clipboard.
    *   Files/folders matching patterns in `codelensai.excludeFromTree` (based on their path *relative* to the copied root) will be omitted from the output.
    *   Available via inline icon on Directory items and context menu on Session items.

10. **Edit Generated Code/Diff (Optional):**
    *   Documents opened by "Generate Code Block" or "Generate Diff" are standard editor tabs. Edit them freely before copying/saving. Changes here don't affect the session or your Git history.

## Configuring Exclusions üö´

There are two types of exclusions:

### 1. Content Exclusions (Drag & Drop - `codelensai.exclude`)

Prevent unwanted files/folders from being added **when dragging from the Explorer**.
*   Operates on **full file system paths**.
*   Does **not** apply when using "Add Active Editor" or "Add All Open Editors".

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  // ... other settings ...
  "codelensai.exclude": {
    "**/.git": true,          // Ignore .git folders anywhere
    "**/node_modules": true,  // Ignore node_modules anywhere
    "**/target": true,
    "**/build": true,
    "**/*.log": true,         // Ignore all .log files
    "**/.DS_Store": true,
    "**/dist": true,          // Ignore dist folders
    ".vscode/**": true       // Ignore files inside .vscode folder at root
  }
}
```

### 2. Structure Copy Exclusions (`codelensai.excludeFromTree`)

Prevent specific files/folders from appearing in the output of the **"Copy Directory Structure"** action.
*   Operates on paths **relative to the root** of the structure being copied (either the session root or the selected directory).
*   Use standard glob patterns.

**Example `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  // ... other settings ...
  "codelensai.excludeFromTree": {
    // Common patterns (often match defaults in .gitignore)
    ".git": true,
    "node_modules": true,
    "target": true,
    "build": true,
    "dist": true,
    "*.log": true,         // Exclude log files at any level within the copied structure
    "__pycache__": true,
    ".DS_Store": true,
    "*.lock": true,        // Exclude lock files
    "temp/**": true       // Exclude everything inside a 'temp' folder within the structure
  }
}
```

**Glob Pattern Tips:**

-   `**` : Matches multiple directory levels (`**/node_modules` matches it anywhere).
-   `*` : Matches zero or more characters except `/`.
-   Use `/` as the path separator in patterns.
-   Patterns in `excludeFromTree` match relative to the item you clicked "Copy Structure" on.

## Line Numbering (Optional)

-   Use the view title action "Toggle Line Numbers" to quickly enable/disable numbering for generated session content.
-   Command: `codelensai.toggleLineNumbers` (also available from the Command Palette).
-   Setting: `codelensai.numberLines` (boolean, default `false`).

Example `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "codelensai.numberLines": true
}
```

## Requirements

-   Visual Studio Code version `1.97.0` or higher.
-   **Git Extension (`vscode.git`):** The built-in Git extension must be enabled for Git Diff functionality.

## Known Issues & Considerations

-   **External Resource Changes:** If a resource added to a session is changed, moved, or deleted *externally*, the link in the CodeLens AI view becomes stale. Generating content, diffing, or opening it may fail. Remove stale items manually (`‚ùå`).
-   **Git Diff Scope:** Diff functionality only applies to `file://` URIs that are part of a Git repository recognized by the `vscode.git` extension. Untracked files and non-file resources are ignored. Performance on very large repositories or diffs may vary.
-   **Structure Copy Relative Paths:** The relative path calculation for `excludeFromTree` works best for standard `file://` URIs within a workspace. Its behavior for non-file URIs or complex nested structures might be less precise.
-   **Binary Files:** Content display/diffing for binary files may be incorrect or skipped.
-   **Performance:** Adding huge directories or generating content/diffs for sessions with many very large files might take time.
-   **Reordering Scope:** Drag-and-drop reordering only works between items at the same level (siblings within the session root or within the same parent directory).
